On a cold day, i take a walk in the park. I meet an old woman, short, slim.
She asks me a question : What is the time. I tell her the time, and then i go home. At home, i talk with my sister. She cooks a soup in the kitchen. In the afternoon, i go to buy pants. They are beautiful. I eat a sandwich and cookies. Later, i drink wine and read a short book. I am tired. I go to sleep early.
