<p>Essentially, the process of deployment in the case of larger applications follows the same principles as it does launching a tiny landing page.</p>
<p>It might be a little more risky to implement changes onto a system
of elevated complexity. So you might put a special focus on testing.</p>

<p>Anyway, once online, the application clearly faces other challenges than small websites, such as growing user load, higher demands regarding availability and performance, and other needs in security aspects.</p>

<p>The trouble starts many times when more and more people are working on the project and more different programming languages, working styles and disciplines get involved, and on this point, not only a few companies suddenly see themselves confronted with an intricate mess of what formerly constituted the application's infrastructure.</p>

<p>
The virtual op can help you there :
</p>

<p>It sets up and configures your virtual environment automatically, absolutely independent from which hosting service you chose.</p>

<p>It represents all of your virtual machines, source code repositories, services, actions and domains in one transparent overview.</p>

<p>It takes care of monitoring, of the storage and analysis of your log data in order to improve the performance of your application and of periodical backups and disposability of restore mechanisms.</p>

<p>It facilitates the cooperation of many developers in real time, providing not only the continuous integration of the source code, but also quick information about the actions taken by the different members 
of a dev team.</p>

<p>Wether you are looking for an all-round solution including hosting and domains, or you want a software to implement it into your existing company operation system - we offer you both, and further more, service level agreements in case that you want us to help you with the implementation - not much more than that, cause as already mentioned, the idea is that the thing is running on it's own.</p>
