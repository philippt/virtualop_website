<h1>The virtualop is a framework for automating the setup, deployment and operations of web applications.</h1>

<br/>
<p>The basic idea is to help you get your web app online and keep it running:

<div id="bild">
<img src="/pix/sourcetoapp.png" />
</div>

</p>

<p>To accomplish this, we use the virtualop to setup a number of infrastructure services around your web application:
<div class="bild">
  <!--img src="/pix/appwithfriends.png" /-->    
</div>
</p>

<p>The specific requirements of how your application should be integrated are specified as part of your project's code source, in files that we call service descriptors.</p>

<p>When your application is integrated into it's runtime environment, it is deployed automatically onto a dedicated production environment consisting of a two-node cluster:
<div class="bild">
  <!--img src="/pix/prod_setup.png" /-->
</div>
</p>

<p>All data from your application is backed up regularly and stored in a data repository:
    
</p>

<p>This data repository can be used to provide test data for setting up copies of your production system for development and testing:</p>
