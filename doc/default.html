<h1>The virtualop is a framework for automating the setup, deployment and operations of web applications.</h1>

<br/>
<p>It is written using the Ruby programming language, consists of a relatively small core, a command line interface, a web interface and a growing number of plugins and services.</p>

<p>The plugins contain logic for setting up the virtualop platform, which is a set of virtual machines deployed across 3 different physical hosts (two for production, one for staging). This platform is self-deploying, i.e. it automatically deploys new versions of itself onto the staging environment, tests them there and updates itself on successful completion of all tests. A similar mechanism can be used to setup machines for development and integrate changes prepared there.</p>

<p>The framework's design makes it easy to integrate a variety of services into the platform, and if any part of the platform does not fit your needs, you can replace it with your own version.</p>

<p>The virtualop is still in an alpha stage - parts of the functionality are completed, including:
<ul>
  <li>installation: setup new virtual machines with CentOS or Ubuntu</li>
  <li>deployment: install your projects from github, through git, subversion or from ownCloud
      <ul>
        <li>github: if you connect your github account, the virtualop initializes new repositories and manages SSH keys for you.</li>
        <li>ownCloud: The minimal platform comes with a built-in owncloud server, and the virtualop prepares development machines with an owncloud client connected to it.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>canned services</b>&nbsp;deploy #{services_count} services with one click</li>
  <li><b>monitoring:</b>&nbsp;Nagios configuration is automatically generated for new machines</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>What is missing for public consumption is:
<ul>
    <li>documentation</li>
    <li>security</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If you are new to the virtualop, you will probably want to take a look at the web interface first - you can reach it <a href="#insert_link_here">here</a>.</p>
