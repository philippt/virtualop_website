<h1>The virtualop is a framework for automating the setup, deployment and operations of web applications.</h1>

<br/>
<p>It is written using the Ruby programming language, consists of a relatively small core, a command line and a web interface. It acts as a container for a growing number of plugins and services.</p>

<p>The plugins contain logic for setting up the virtualop platform, which is a set of virtual machines deployed across multiple physical 
hosts (e.g. two for production, one for staging).<br/>
This platform is self-deploying, i.e. it automatically deploys new versions of itself onto the staging environment, 
tests them there and updates itself on successful completion of all tests.<br/>
A similar mechanism can be used to setup machines for development and integrate changes prepared there.</p>

<p>The framework's design makes it easy to integrate a variety of services into the platform, and if any part of the platform 
does not fit your needs, you can replace it with your own version with one click.</p>

<p>You can use it to:
<ul>
  <li><b>setup</b > new virtual machines with CentOS or Ubuntu</li>
  <li><b>deploy</b> projects from github, through git, subversion or an ownCloud
      <ul>
        <li>github: if you connect your github account, the virtualop initializes new repositories and manages SSH keys for you.</li>
        <li>ownCloud: The minimal platform comes with a built-in owncloud server, and the virtualop prepares development machines with an owncloud client connected to it.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>install</b> #{services_count} canned services</li>
  <li><b>configure</b> respectively generate configuration for
  	<ul>
  		<li>nagios</li>
  		<li>iptables</li>
  		<li>apache</li>
  	</ul>
</ul>
<br/>

Also, we integrated
<ul>  	
  <li><b>jenkins</b> for automated build</li>
  <li><b>389-ds as LDAP directory service</b></li>
  <li><b>PowerDNS</b></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>All of this means that you get a self-deploying platform that will allow users to integrate their projects in a way that they are self-deploying as well.</p>

<p>What is missing for public consumption is:
<ul>
    <li>documentation</li>
    <li>security</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If you are new to the virtualop, you will probably want to take a look at the web interface first - you can reach it <a href="#insert_link_here">here</a>.</p>
