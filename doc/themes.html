<h2>Themes and css styling</h2>
If you got the virtualop running on your local working environment, you might want to implement your own design.
<br />

You can set up your own theme in your working copy by adding a folder in /app/assets/themes.<br />
The common stylesheets contain stuff like paddings, widths, margins, and other structural configurations.<br />
You can use the following organization of stylesheets to add the back- and foreground color, font styles, borders and the like. 
<br /><br />
<h2>Index</h2><br />
<h1>main.css</h1>Contains the frame and main layout of the application, like the content wrapper, the header, default styles for tables, the sign-in, sign-up, change-password view and others.<br />
<h1>widgets.css</h1>The content of all the widget boxes in the dashboard, except of the connections widget and the my requests widget, which you can find in dashboard.css<br />
