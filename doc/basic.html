<p>You are a web developer and simply want to setup a website in the internet ?</p>
<p>We offer to connect your github repositories to the virtualop.</p>
<p>You don't know what is github ?</p><a href="#" class="doyou">No, no idea</a><a href="#" class="doyou">I know github</a>
<p>You enjoy all the advantages you got in github, as there is, for example, the version control.</p>
<p>But you also enjoy to go one step further, that is : To get the written code on the web, on a domain that you choose, and to distinguish between your development environment, where you can test changes without endangering the apearance or functionality of your running web application, and a production environment, where you deploy your new versions once you decided they are ready to be seen in public.</p>
<p>At the moment, we use a dropbox connection aswell. It is a really nice way to work : You make changes on your files in the dropbox, and once you click "save", you see the dropbox processing and with a reload of page that links to your development machine you got your changes online.</p>
<p>Anyway, we are not convinced that the performance of the connection is sufficient. We are working on a similar system that is more functional.</p>
<br />
<p>Once the first version of the website is online, you should be informed about the status of your virtual machines. In the most simple case, that's two, right - a development and a productive machine.</p>
<p>With the virtual op monitoring you can see wether the individual projects you got on the machines are running or not.</p>
<p>With backup and restore you can "save" a version of your application, and later on reload it, in case that further changes had an undesirable result.</p>
<p>We also automated a couple of services that up to now are annoying to install : For example, <a href="#" class="drupal">>drupal</a> or <a href="" class="doyou">>magento</a></p>
