<h2>Dashboard, Widgets, Dashboard Tabs</h2>

The dashboard gives you a fast overview over the most important components
of your infrastructure. <br />
You can customize the dashboard by adding widgets clicking the "add-widget" button. <br /> 
The widgets allow you to see a summary of the different sections.<br />
For example, the "my requests"- widget shows you all of your current requests. In order to see all the request, you must access the logging-section in the navigation.<br /><br />

These are the widgets you can add at the moment :<br /><br />

<h1>Connections</h1>
- Shows you wether or not your github- and/or dropbox account is connected to the virtualop.<br />
<h1>My requests</h1>
- Shows you the recent requests.<br />
You got them archived in the logging section.
<h1>Projects</h1>
- Shows you your five most edited projects. <br />
In the corresponding section of the dashboard tabs you can find all the details :<br />
- Wether it's a github or dropbox project.<br />
- Further details on github projects when you click on the header in the github-projects box.<br />
<h1>Machines</h1>
- Shows you your three most modified machines. <br />
In the dashboard tabs you can see all of your machines, sorted by development- and production machines or alphabetically.<br />
Here you can see immediately if a machine is running or not.<br />
<h1>Links</h1>
...ah, that's just a gimmick for people who want to constantly connect to certain sites, let's say, news sites. Afterwards we want to have a news-of-the-world widget or so, but that'll do till then. Put a name and the url you wanna connect to. <br />
