<h2>We want to make agile software cycles really agile. Everything automated. One click away.</h2>

<div class="column">
<p>How? Well, we believe in <span class="buzzword">continuous delivery</span>:
<ul>
<li>We want to setup developers fast, and give them just what they need: a reliable production replica to work with.</li>
<li>We want developers to feel confident enough to commit at will. And to know what happened immediately after.</li>
</div>


<div class="column">
<li>We want to make sure everything gets integrated and tested in an automated way.
</li>
<li>We want to make sure that you can rollout whenever you want.</li>
<li>We want to make your ops an integral part of the process. From scratch.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>

<div class="column"
<p>
<li>We want to make sure scalability, availability, security, reliability, all become a natural consequence of the cycle -and not the result of a top-down late-panic intervention.</li>
In fact, we want no more Devs and Ops. We want to help create a culture of relaxed, easy-going, fun-loving software dudes. Tons of them. Taking it easy, with no early starts nor late nights. Things getting done after the first cups of espresso are down, jokes exchanged, news checked, feeds updated and mails answered.
