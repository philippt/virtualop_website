<h2>We want to make agile software cycles really agile. Everything automated. One click away.</h2>


<div class="column">
<p>We believe in <span class="buzzword">continous delivery</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to setup developers fast, and give them just what they need: a reliable production replica to work with.</li>
<li>We want developers to feel confident enough to commit at will. And to know what happened immediately after.</li>
<li>We want to make sure everything gets integrated and tested in an automated way.
</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div class="column">
<ul>
<li>We want to make sure that you can rollout whenever you want.</li>
<br />
<li>We want to make your ops an integral part of the process. From scratch.</li>
<br />
<li>We want to make sure scalability, availability, security, reliability, all become a natural consequence of the cycle -and not the result of a top-down late-panic intervention.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="column">
<p>
In fact, we want no more Devs and Ops. We want to help create a culture of relaxed, easy-going, fun-loving software dudes. Tons of them.
<br />
Taking it easy, with no early starts nor late nights.
<br />
Things getting done after the first cups of espresso are down, jokes exchanged, news checked, feeds updated and mails answered.
