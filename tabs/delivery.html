<h1>Continous Delivery starts with efficient Development Setup.</h1>

<ul>
<li>Setting up a developer's workspace must be a one-click task.</li>
<li>A developer's workspace must be a close replica to the live system- <br />
...in fact, it has to be treated from a configuration standpoint just as production.</li>

<li>Configuration management and handovers must be completely automated</li>
</ul>
<h2>-..no more "it works on my machine"</h2>
<h3>-..no more "just tweak this parameter and it works"</h3>
</div>

<div class="column_delivery2">

<ul>
<li>Continuous delivery is enforced by enabling and encouraging continuous commits, integration and testing.</li>
<li><a href="">commit, test, integrate</a>: just do it, several times a day.<br />
You might not need to roll out features every few hours, but if needed, it must be possible.</li>
<li>It must be possible to set up your whole system from scratch as a one- click from dev's latest commit.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Anytime.</h4>
