<h1>Continous Delivery starts with efficient Development Setup.</h1>
<p>Setting up a developer's workspace must be a one-click task.</p>
<p>A developer's workspace must be a close replica to the live system-</p>
<p>...in fact, it has to be treated from a configuration standpoint just as production.</p>

<p>Configuration management and handovers must be completely automated</p>

<h2>-..no more "it works on my machine"</h2>
<h3>-..no more "just tweak this parameter and it works"</h3>

<p>Continuos delivery is enforced by enabling and encouraging continous commits, integration and testing.</p>
<p>COMMIT, TEST, INTEGRATE : just do it, several times a day.</p>
<p>You might not need to roll out features every few hours, but if needed, it must be possible.</p>
<p>It must be possible to set up your whole system from scratch as a one- click from dev's latest commit.</p>
<h4>Anytime.</h4>
