<p>Continous Delivery starts with efficient Development Setup</p>
<p>Setting up a developer's workspace must be a one-click task.
<p>A developer's workspace must be a close replica to the live system</p>
<p>...in fact, it has to be treated from a configuration standpoint just as production.</p>

<p>configuration management and handovers must be completely automated</p>
<p>-..no more "it works on my machine"</p>
<p>-..no more "just tweak this parameter and it works"</p>

<div class="column_delivery">
<p>continuos delivery is enforced by enabling and encouraging continous commits, integration and testing.</p>
<p>commit, test, integrate : just do it, several times a day.</p>
<p>You might not need to roll out features every few hours, but if needed, it must be possible.</p>
<p>It must be possible to set up your whole system from scratch as a one- click from dev's next latest commit.</p>
<p>Anytime.<p>
